I have deployed my solution on: https://lambent-kulfi-bed1a7.netlify.app/

This project is done with Angular 13.

If you want to deploy it:
1.	In terminal, forward to project folder “honeywellTest”.
2.	Run “npm install” to install dependent packages.
3.	Run “ng build” to compile the project.
4.	The deployable project will be generated in the folder “honeywellTest/dist”.
5.	Deploy the generated project with any live server tool.
